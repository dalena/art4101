                     <p>
                        This studio course critically engages with moving images. We will generate, manipulate, and
                        animate digital imagery into durative, artistic projects. To develop a broader context
                        around moving images, we will watch, read, create, critique, and discuss. We will screen
                        time-based works and study a collection of texts in relationship to historical,
                        contemporary, and experimental uses of time-based digital media.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>
                        The developments in digital imaging, computer simulation, and animation has shifted notions
                        of cinema and techniques of film/artmaking into ever-evolving forms. In the beginning of
                        this course, we will create a constellation of short, experimental projects that aim to
                        familiarize our art practices with various media, software, techniques, contexts, and
                        implications of animated computer imaging. The later duration of this course is aimed at
                        synthesizing the relevant technical and creative concepts learned throughout the course into
                        a self-directed, final project. Final works will be publicly exhibited at the end of the
                        semester.
                     </p>

                     </ul>
                     <h3>Health & Safety Requirements</h3>
                     <p>All students, faculty and staff are required to comply with and stay up to date on all <a
                        href="https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank">university safety and health
                        guidance</a> <span class="print">(https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu)</span>, which includes
                        wearing a face mask in any indoor space and maintaining a safe physical distance at all
                        times. Non-compliance will be warned first and disciplinary actions will be taken for
                        repeated offenses.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Format & Delivery</h3>
                     <p>This is a process-oriented studio. It is comprised of presentations, assignments,
                        participatory activities and exercises, individual and group discussions, and reviews. This
                        course is <span class="highlight">hybrid or in-person</span>. Synchronous Zoom meetings will
                        be used for the introduction of assignments, some demonstrations, breakout group meetings,
                        and group critique discussions. Other activities such as working on assignments and
                        exercises, viewing videos, and reading assignments will be executed synchronously and
                        asynchronously. In-person activities will include demonstrations, presentations, group
                        exercises, and critiques. Weekly announcements will serve to inform when activities will
                        take place.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                     <p>A hybrid course provides online learning opportunities for up to 74% of the semester. That
                        means that up to three-fourths of your in-class meeting time may occur at a distance with
                        the expectation that your full attention will be given to this course during the scheduled
                        two hour and forty minute long meeting times, regardless if you are meeting physically or
                        otherwise.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Credit Hours & Work Expectations</h3>
                     <p>This is a 3-credit-hour, 16-week studio course. According to Ohio State policy, students
                        should expect
                        around 6 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (instructor content and Carmen
                        activities,
                        for example) in addition to 3 hours of out of class work such as reading, viewing videos and
                        films,
                        exercises, projects, & discord interactions to receive a grade of (C) average. In total,
                        students
                        should be prepared to commit a minimum of 9 hours per week to this course.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Attendance</h3>
                     <p>Please arrive on time for each class session. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will
                        be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. The Department of Art
                        acknowledges that illness, family obligations, and other conflicts with your classes do
                        occur from time to time and up to three absences are allowed for any reason during the
                        semester without penalty. All absences from class will be counted, however, and in the
                        instance that you miss three class meetings, you are required to meet us to discuss
                        strategies for avoiding additional absences. Each unexcused absence afterwards will result
                        in one full letter grade deduction (e.g. B+ to C+). Six unexcused absences (20% of the
                        semester) results in a failure of the course. Absences will not be excused after the fact
                        except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctorâ€™s note. Any disputes should be
                        discussed within two weeks.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                     <p>It has been determined that some in-person learning is necessary for you to successfully
                        engage with your instructor and peers, course activities, and to meet learning objectives.
                        Timely and consistent contributions are critical in all formats used to deliver the content
                        of this course. In the instance of class-wide quarantine or campus closure, a course
                        contingency plan has been designed so that we can transition to an exclusively online format
                        if we are required to actuate one. <span class="highlight">Attendance will be taken
                        regardless of delivery format</span>.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Participation</h3>
                     <p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the
                        assessment of your progress. You are expected to be present and active for the entire class
                        period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share
                        your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback
                        during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and
                        supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of
                        different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we
                        are building together. Donâ€™t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility,
                        apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Communication</h3>
                     <p><a href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> <span
                        class="print">(http://discordapp.com/)</span> is used as our primary mode of
                        communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a
                           href="https://discord.gg/Xv8rwUv" target="_blank">server</a>, and keep up to date with
                        announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings,
                        screenings, and learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Discord Server Interaction</h3>
                     <p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord server is required. We will use
                        Discord to gather and share resources, respond to readings and peers' works, and to share
                        your work in progress.
                     </p>
                     <p>Each week should feature at least:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Link to your exercise/project with a short description of your learning process,
                           concept, challenges, and triumphs. This way your work is contextualized for your peers
                           in relation to your creative inputs and the readings.
                        </li>
                        <li>Respond to at least two of your peers' exercises and project submissions.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <h3>Readings & Discussions</h3>
                     <p>During the semester, you will be assigned readings on a variety of topics. The readings are
                        intended to familiarize you with some of the relevant discussions that relate to the field.
                        We will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers in class. Your participation in
                        these discussions matters. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn from
                        one another and explore the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a
                        foundation for discussing the screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of
                        the ideas from the readings in practice.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Projects</h3>
                     <p>Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to
                        one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than
                        one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in
                        projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save
                        issues, software errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your
                        desktop, online, and/or on an external hard drive or USB stick in case your computer is
                        lost.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Grading</h3>

                     <p>Back up your work. Inevitably, computers crash. Sometimes they get stolen. There are measures
                        that you can take to prevent significant loss of data. These include Cloud back-ups,
                        external devices or disc storage.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Commitment to Equity & Diversity</h3>
                     <p>The classroom is a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and
                        cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge
                        and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use
                        preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
                        Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our
                        conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that
                        certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are
                        undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or
                        vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and
                        instructors is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should
                        feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that
                        something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
                        instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one
                        another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece
                        of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor. (<a

                     <p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body.
                        Our programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to
                        provide opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them.
                        We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth
                        and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among
                        each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach \sout{his or
                        her} their own potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status,
                        which is defined as age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin,
                        race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is prohibited.

                        anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental

                     <h2>Departmental Notes & College Policies</h2>
                     <h3>PPE & Related College Covid Policies</h3>
                     <p>Safe campus requirements include but are not limited to wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical
                        distancing, health symptom monitoring, participating in contact tracing, quarantine and
                        isolation, and additional safety expectations detailed at <a href="safeandhealthy.osu.edu"
                           target="_blank">safeandhealthy.osu.edu</a>. All Ohio State students, faculty and staff
                        are expected to meet the behavioral and safety expectations under the Safe Campus
                        Requirements when they physically participate in any university activity, on or off campus.
                        All students, faculty and staff also will be required to perform a daily health check to
                        report body temperature each day they intend to be physically on an Ohio State campus.
                        Failure to adhere to these requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement
                        mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation, whereby adherence will be reinforced
                        through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary action whenever
                        possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
                        follows:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the
                           student and/or student organization's behavior endangers the health or safety of campus
                           community members, on or off campus, and/or fails to comply with the directives outlined
                           in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which a student is not
                           adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this
                           does not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy
                           requirements. If the student continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave
                           the location and not to return until they are prepared to follow the requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident
                           should be reported to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential
                           disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate tracking. Even if the student's name
                           is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the university in
                           evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be acknowledged that Student Conduct
                           will be unable to take disciplinary action without identifying information.

                     <h3>COVID-19 Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h3>
                     <p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required
                        quarantine due to exposure will transition course activities to distance learning to the
                        extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students will work with
                        instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities
                        related to course objectives and assignments will be provided.
                     </p>
                     <p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online
                        interactions and learning at a distance will occur. All university standards and policies
                        remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for students with
                        disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be
                        meeting and interacting in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves
                        and treat others as if we are meeting in person.
                     </p>
                     <p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online
                        delivery mode for the remainder of the semester.
                     </p>
                     <p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis,
                        symptoms, or required quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course
                        continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may transition to an online delivery mode
                        temporarily.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Accommodations</h3>
                     <p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to
                        make <i>reasonable accommodations</i> for students who are unable to be safely present in
                        the classroom <i>and</i> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of Student
                        Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean
                        streaming lectures on Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that
                        involve laboratory work, studio work, or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable
                        accommodation will not always be possible. Students are expected to work with their advisors
                        and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling needs.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Sexual Misconduct/Relationship Violence</h3>
                     <p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
                        offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied
                        to offenses against other protected categories (e.g., race). If you or someone you know has
                        been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate resources at <a
                           href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank">http://titleix.osu.edu/</a>
                        \href{http://titleix.osu.edu/}{http://titleix.osu.edu} or by contacting the Ohio State Title
                        IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at <a href="mailto:titleix@osu.edu"
                           target="_blank">titleix@osu.edu</a>
                     </p>
                     <h3>Trigger Warning</h3>
                     <p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to
                        descriptions of and/or scenes depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence
                        and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while watching/reading this
                        material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend,
                        contacting a Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a href="tel:614292111"
                           target="_blank">614-292-1111</a>, or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a
                           href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank">614-292-5766</a>, and contacting the instructor if
                        needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming
                        this media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to
                        each other may result in dismissal from the class.
                     </p>
                     <h3>General Class and Studio Policies</h3>
                     <p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
                        and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual
                        orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
                        to the instructor and may include the student's legal name unless changed via the University
                        Name Change policy. We will gladly honor your request to address you by another name or
                        gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so that we may make
                        appropriate changes to our records.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language,
                        imagery, or dialogue that may be challenging or offend some students. While no student is
                        required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or design that offends them,
                        it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful
                        manner. Art can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively
                        discussion, concepts and imagery. Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.)
                        can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and provocative, so please, engage
                        in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as possible.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>Please contact us in advance (during the first week of class or as soon as circumstances
                        develop during the term) if you have circumstances that may affect your performance and
                        ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this course.

                  <h2>Exercises</h2>
                  <p>Exercises in the course are detailed and specific in scope to <u>introduce us</u> to formal and
                     conceptual practices of moving images. If you are putting an undue amount of time or pressure on
                     yourself on an exercise, then you are doing it wrong! They are meant to be quick and playful.
                     Your exercises will be screened in class to launch us into discussions about exploration,
                     process, and form. The skills and techniques gained from our exercises will equipt us with
                     strategies to produce our class projects throughout the semester.

                        <p>Exercise 2 investigates the relationship sound has with the moving image. This exercise
                           is broken down into two parts and involves a partner (only for the second part).</p>

                        <h4>PART ONE â€” DUE:</h4>
                        <p>
                        Select a pre-existing video track to work with between 1-2 minutes long. This can be from any source you can get your hands on. It can be a music video you like, a piece of footage you recorded from a trip, an advertisement recording, or a scene from your favorite film, for example. Remove any audio that may accompany the original video track. Create your own audio track by using an  video editing program of your choice. You can use field recordings, sound libraries/effects, music, and voice narration. 
                        Think about the interaction between the visual material and audio material but <span class="highlight">Do not edit the video.</span> Think about how
                        the sound can change the way we perceive and experience the image.</p>

                           <li>1-2 minute video</li>
                           <li>Video should be 1920 x 1080 in resolution and exported as an .MP4 format</li>

                        This second part requires a partner. Swap the same visual track from the first part
                        <b>without sound</b> with your partner. Using their visual sequence selection as the visual track for this exercise,
                        create an audio track to accompany the video. Reiterated from the first part, you can use
                        field recordings, sound libraries/effects, music, and voice narration. Think about the interaction between the visual material and audio material but <span class="highlight">Do not edit the video.</span> Think about how

                           technique, software, or tool in a way that it is not normally to be used. We will learn

                        <p>Exercise X is a semester-long collaborative project in which we will experiment with the
                           creation, curation, and dissemination of digital images in a networked society. It is
                           separated into two parts:

                        Pick a search term. Collect <b><u>10 images</u></b> from the search results using the search
                        term (Ask me if you need help getting the photo from a platform).
                        This can be Google Images, DuckDuckGo, Twitter, Instagram, Are.na, Tumblr, Pintrest,
                        Facebook, Amazon, Reddit,
                        Flickr, and so on ++ <i class="highlight">Your selected images will contribute to a
                        collective database for

                        <p>One after another, each student will have 3 days to generate a collage using only the
                           images from our curated database. This exercise will utilize the exhibition practices
                           inherit in Instagram's grid feature. Collages will be uploaded onto our class Instagram
                           account as they are generated.

                        <br>
                        <p>This exercise is designed to challenge this course's implications of what a "moving
                           image" is. Instead of contextualizing moving images purely within the scope of
                           time-based art (usually resulting in a video format), this exercise asks us to consider
                           how digital images may move within social spaces, digital platforms, data
                           infrastructures; how images today are consumed, curated, manipulated, generated,
                           disseminated, and exhibited; how digital images may contribute to larger technological
                           and social structures in our daily lives.

                                    online, to create a column of digital compost. Therefore, many of the

                     <p>
                        Digital tools are ideal for sampling pre-existing media elements and remixing - or transforming - them into new creative works. With these tools we have the ability to hybridize, collage, combine, cut, paste and duplicate infinitely. Another strategy is to erase, or relocate elements in order to point out new possibilities or relationships. Consider repurposing existing media in surprising ways to create a personal statement, an alternate reality, a political statement, a poetic statement, or a joining of the past with the future.<span class="highlight">**</span>

                        the source material  to generate an entirely new creative work?

                     <h4>Description</h4>
                     <p>"What Just Happened?" you ask yourself. The last thing you remember is a flash of white light
                        and now you seem to be in some kind of waiting room. You're asked to take a number and have
                        a seat. The blades on the ceiling fan whirl in hypnotic fashion. Slowed-down swing music
                        plays through the intercom speakers. There are other people around you. They are mostly
                        individuals, much older than yourself,
                        but there is a young boy sitting on his father's lap. Both your eyes meet with the same
                        confused
                        gaze. When your number is called, you move to a new room. There
                        are windows that overlook the overcast sky and bare trees against the building. It looks
                        chilly.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>
                        <i>Where is this? Where am I?</i>
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>
                        Everything is too common but the place is unfamiliar. The dull, grey light
                        framed by the windows illuminates the surface of a wooden table. A
                        man sitting at the table gestures toward the empty chair across from
                        him. Taking the cue, you walk towards him and sit down.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>Here, you're informed of your recent passing. You're dead. So is everyone else around you.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p> "...I'm sorry for your loss..." the man says. He bows his head and closes
                        his eyes. You're both silent for a few moments.
                     </p>
                     <p>You're informed that you are in an in-between space between life and afterlife <span
                        class="highlight">**</span>. You are to stay here for several weeks where you will be
                        given a private room to live the last of your days and take on a final project.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>The man elaborates on this project, "...while you are here, you must select one memory. One
                        memory that was most meaningful or precious to you. Once you have chosen your memory, you
                        will try your best to re-create this memory on video. You can use the many skills, tools,
                        and media already available to you before you arrived here. We will screen these at the end
                        of your stay, along with the others you may have seen in our waiting room earlier today. As
                        soon as you have relived your memory, you will move on. Taking only the memory with you."
                     </p><br>
                     <p><i>This effort to represent memories using media is more a creative endeavor than an accurate
                        one-to-one depiction of what actually happened and what you remember. How can you
                        situate the video you make for this project in this volatile, affective reality?</i>
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>
                        <span
                        class="highlight">**</span> <i>afterlife is used subjectively and can mean anything (or nothing) to you.</i>

                     <h4>Description</h4>
                     <p>Your final project is an open investigation of your interests and the techniques learned
                        throughout the course that culminate into a single video. Your project must synthesize the course materials and techniques
                        and/or respond to some of the subjects discussed in the class. It must be paired with audio
                        which can be
                        musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 3 to
                        7 minutes. You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                        exploration of advanced and experimental techniques, software and frameworks that were not
                        touched on in the class, social and political issues, personal and interpersonal
                        investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention, and exploration
                        are highly encouraged. Your final projects will be exhibited online on a dedicated website.
