                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            This studio course critically engages with moving images. We will generate, manipulate, and
                            animate digital imagery into durative, artistic projects. To develop a broader context
                            around moving images, we will watch, read, create, critique, and discuss. We will screen
                            time-based works and study a collection of texts in relationship to historical,
                            contemporary, and experimental uses of time-based digital media.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The developments in digital imaging, computer simulation, and animation has shifted notions
                            of cinema and techniques of film/artmaking into ever-evolving forms. In the beginning of
                            this course, we will create a constellation of short, experimental projects that aim to
                            familiarize our art practices with various media, software, techniques, contexts, and
                            implications of animated computer imaging. The later duration of this course is aimed at
                            synthesizing the relevant technical and creative concepts learned throughout the course into
                            a self-directed, final project. Final works will be publicly exhibited at the end of the
                            semester.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="highlight">Experimentation with media, non-traditional tools, platforms, and
                            methods are encouraged.</span>

                        <h3>Learning Goals</h3>

                        <h3>Health & Safety Requirements</h3>
                        <p>All students, faculty and staff are required to comply with and stay up to date on all <a
                                href="https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank">university safety and health
                                guidance</a> <span class="print">(https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu)</span>, which includes
                            wearing a face mask in any indoor space and maintaining a safe physical distance at all
                            times. Non-compliance will be warned first and disciplinary actions will be taken for
                            repeated offenses.</p>

                        <h3>Format & Delivery</h3>
                        <p>This is a process-oriented studio. It is comprised of presentations, assignments,
                            participatory activities and exercises, individual and group discussions, and reviews. This
                            course is <span class="highlight">hybrid or in-person</span>. Synchronous Zoom meetings will
                            be used for the introduction of assignments, some demonstrations, breakout group meetings,
                            and group critique discussions. Other activities such as working on assignments and
                            exercises, viewing videos, and reading assignments will be executed synchronously and
                            asynchronously. In-person activities will include demonstrations, presentations, group
                            exercises, and critiques. Weekly announcements will serve to inform when activities will
                            take place.</p><br>

                        <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                        <p>A hybrid course provides online learning opportunities for up to 74% of the semester. That
                            means that up to three-fourths of your in-class meeting time may occur at a distance with
                            the expectation that your full attention will be given to this course during the scheduled
                            two hour and forty minute long meeting times, regardless if you are meeting physically or
                            otherwise.</p>

                        <h3>Credit Hours & Work Expectations</h3>
                        <p>This is a 3-credit-hour, 16-week studio course. According to Ohio State policy, students
                            should expect
                            around 6 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (instructor content and Carmen
                            activities,
                            for example) in addition to 3 hours of out of class work such as reading, viewing videos and
                            films,
                            exercises, projects, & discord interactions to receive a grade of (C) average. In total,
                            students
                            should be prepared to commit a minimum of 9 hours per week to this course.</p>

                        <h3>Attendance</h3>
                        <p>Please arrive on time for each class session. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will
                            be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. The Department of Art
                            acknowledges that illness, family obligations, and other conflicts with your classes do
                            occur from time to time and up to three absences are allowed for any reason during the
                            semester without penalty. All absences from class will be counted, however, and in the
                            instance that you miss three class meetings, you are required to meet us to discuss
                            strategies for avoiding additional absences. Each unexcused absence afterwards will result
                            in one full letter grade deduction (e.g. B+ to C+). Six unexcused absences (20% of the
                            semester) results in a failure of the course. Absences will not be excused after the fact
                            except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctorâ€™s note. Any disputes should be
                            discussed within two weeks.</p><br>

                        <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>

                        <p>It has been determined that some in-person learning is necessary for you to successfully
                            engage with your instructor and peers, course activities, and to meet learning objectives.
                            Timely and consistent contributions are critical in all formats used to deliver the content
                            of this course. In the instance of class-wide quarantine or campus closure, a course
                            contingency plan has been designed so that we can transition to an exclusively online format
                            if we are required to actuate one. <span class="highlight">Attendance will be taken
                                regardless of delivery format</span>.</p>

                        <h3>Participation</h3>
                        <p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the
                            assessment of your progress. You are expected to be present and active for the entire class
                            period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share
                            your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback
                            during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and
                            supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of
                            different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we
                            are building together. Donâ€™t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility,
                            apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.</p>

                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p><a href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> <span
                                class="print">(http://discordapp.com/)</span> is used as our primary mode of
                            communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a
                                href="https://discord.gg/Xv8rwUv" target="_blank">server</a>, and keep up to date with
                            announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings,
                            screenings, and learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.</p>

                        <h3>Discord Server Interaction</h3>
                        <p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord server is required. We will use
                            Discord to gather and share resources, respond to readings and peers' works, and to share
                            your work in progress.</p>

                        <p>Each week should feature at least:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Link to your exercise/project with a short description of your learning process,
                                concept, challenges, and triumphs. This way your work is contextualized for your peers
                                in relation to your creative inputs and the readings.</li>
                            <li>Respond to at least two of your peers' exercises and project submissions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Readings & Discussions</h3>
                        <p>During the semester, you will be assigned readings on a variety of topics. The readings are
                            intended to familiarize you with some of the relevant discussions that relate to the field.
                            We will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers in class. Your participation in
                            these discussions matters. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn from
                            one another and explore the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a
                            foundation for discussing the screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of
                            the ideas from the readings in practice.</p>

                        <h3>Projects</h3>
                        <p>Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to
                            one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than
                            one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in
                            projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save
                            issues, software errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your
                            desktop, online, and/or on an external hard drive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Grading</h3>
                        <p>Percentage breakdown is as follows:</p>

                        <p>Back up your work. Inevitably, computers crash. Sometimes they get stolen. There are measures
                            that you can take to prevent significant loss of data. These include Cloud back-ups,

                            preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
                            Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our
                            conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that
                            certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are
                            undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or
                            vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and
                            instructors is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should
                            feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that
                            something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
                            instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one
                            another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece
                            of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor. (<a

                        <p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body.
                            Our programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to
                            provide opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them.
                            We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth
                            and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among
                            each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach \sout{his or
                            her} their own potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status,
                            which is defined as age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin,
                            race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is prohibited.</p>
                        <h3>Disability Services</h3>
                        <p>The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you
                            anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental

                        <h3>PPE & Related College Covid Policies</h3>
                        <p>Safe campus requirements include but are not limited to wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical
                            distancing, health symptom monitoring, participating in contact tracing, quarantine and
                            isolation, and additional safety expectations detailed at <a href="safeandhealthy.osu.edu"
                                target="_blank">safeandhealthy.osu.edu</a>. All Ohio State students, faculty and staff
                            are expected to meet the behavioral and safety expectations under the Safe Campus
                            Requirements when they physically participate in any university activity, on or off campus.
                            All students, faculty and staff also will be required to perform a daily health check to
                            report body temperature each day they intend to be physically on an Ohio State campus.
                            Failure to adhere to these requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement
                            mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation, whereby adherence will be reinforced
                            through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary action whenever
                            possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
                            follows:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the
                                student and/or student organization's behavior endangers the health or safety of campus
                                community members, on or off campus, and/or fails to comply with the directives outlined
                                in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which a student is not
                                adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this
                                does not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy
                                requirements. If the student continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave
                                the location and not to return until they are prepared to follow the requirements.</li>
                            <li>For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident
                                should be reported to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential
                                disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate tracking. Even if the student's name
                                is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the university in
                                evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be acknowledged that Student Conduct
                                will be unable to take disciplinary action without identifying information.</li>

                        <h3>COVID-19 Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required
                            quarantine due to exposure will transition course activities to distance learning to the
                            extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students will work with
                            instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities
                            related to course objectives and assignments will be provided.</p>
                        <p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online
                            interactions and learning at a distance will occur. All university standards and policies
                            remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for students with
                            disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be
                            meeting and interacting in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves
                            and treat others as if we are meeting in person.</p>
                        <p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online
                            delivery mode for the remainder of the semester.</p>
                        <p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis,
                            symptoms, or required quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course
                            continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may transition to an online delivery mode
                            temporarily.</p>

                        <h3>Accommodations</h3>
                        <p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to
                            make <i>reasonable accommodations</i> for students who are unable to be safely present in
                            the classroom <i>and</i> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of Student
                            Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean
                            streaming lectures on Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that
                            involve laboratory work, studio work, or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable
                            accommodation will not always be possible. Students are expected to work with their advisors
                            and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling needs.</p>

                        <h3>Sexual Misconduct/Relationship Violence</h3>
                        <p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
                            offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied
                            to offenses against other protected categories (e.g., race). If you or someone you know has
                            been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate resources at <a
                                href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank">http://titleix.osu.edu/</a>
                            \href{http://titleix.osu.edu/}{http://titleix.osu.edu} or by contacting the Ohio State Title
                            IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at <a href="mailto:titleix@osu.edu"
                                target="_blank">titleix@osu.edu</a></p>


                        <h3>Trigger Warning</h3>

                        <p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to
                            descriptions of and/or scenes depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence
                            and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while watching/reading this
                            material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend,
                            contacting a Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a href="tel:614292111"
                                target="_blank">614-292-1111</a>, or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a
                                href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank">614-292-5766</a>, and contacting the instructor if
                            needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming
                            this media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to
                            each other may result in dismissal from the class.</p>


                        <h3>General Class and Studio Policies</h3>

                        <p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
                            and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual
                            orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
                            to the instructor and may include the student's legal name unless changed via the University
                            Name Change policy. We will gladly honor your request to address you by another name or
                            gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so that we may make
                            appropriate changes to our records.</p><br>
                        <p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language,
                            imagery, or dialogue that may be challenging or offend some students. While no student is
                            required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or design that offends them,
                            it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful
                            manner. Art can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively
                            discussion, concepts and imagery. Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.)
                            can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and provocative, so please, engage
                            in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as possible.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Please contact us in advance (during the first week of class or as soon as circumstances
                            develop during the term) if you have circumstances that may affect your performance and
                            ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this course.</p>

                    <h2>Exercises</h2>
                    <p>Exercises in the course are detailed and specific in scope to <u>introduce us</u> to formal and conceptual practices of moving images. If you are putting an undue amount of time or pressure on yourself on an exercise, then you are doing it wrong! They are meant to be quick and playful. Your exercises will be screened in class to launch us into discussions about exploration, process, and form. The skills and techniques gained from our exercises will equipt us with strategies to produce our class projects throughout the semester.</p>

                            <h4>Description</h4>
                            <p>Exercise 2 investigates the relationship sound has with the moving image. This exercise is broken down into two parts and involves a partner (only for the second part).
                            <h5>The First Part:</h5>
                            Choose a subject for investigation. This can be an object (or set of objects), a place, a person, a process, a situation, a context that combines parts of several subjects together. Think of something that directly relates to your own art practice. Use any basic video camera you have access to. This can be your phone's camera, a DSLR, a video camera (be mindful of the conversion process). Capture at least 5 minutes of footage about your subject. Think of ways to capture your subject. Be conscious of the composition of your shots (close-up, medium, wide-angle), camera motion (static, pan, zoom, tilt, hand-held vs tripod), or any other method of breaking down your subject in a visual and temporal way. Edit your footage into a single video sequence between 1 to 3 minutes long. As you edit, ask yourself: Are there moments of ambience (long takes), quick cuts, and loops/repetition? If so, how do these choices of duration affect the viewer's engagement with the moving image? ++ <i class="highlight">Think of the methods you & your peers may have used in the first exercise to transform the single image into a time-based work.</i> Now add audio/sound to your project. You can use field recordings, sound libraries/effects, and voice narration. Think about the interaction between the visual material and audio material. Think about how the sound can change the way we perceive and experience the image and narrative. <b>DO NOT use music for this exercise.</b> </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1-3 minute video</li>

                            <h5>The Second Part:</h5>
                            This second part requires a partner. Export the same video sequence from the first part <b>without sound</b> and exchange with your partner. You will now be working on your partner's video sequence. Using their video sequence as the visual track for this exercise, create an audio track to accompany the video. Reiterated from the first part, you can use field recordings, sound libraries/effects, and voice narration. Think about the interaction between the visual material and audio material. Think about how the sound can change the way we perceive and experience the image and narrative. <b>DO NOT use music for this exercise.</b>

                            <h4>Description</h4>
                            <p>Words are so ubiquitous in daily life that it is often forgotten that the word (i.e, the things you are currently reading now) is one of our earliest forms of media. Words are integral blocks to language and social interactions, for navigating physical and virtual spaces, and identifying and understanding infinite conceptions of our subjective realities. In this sense, words have always been "virtual" â€” its affect existing first in the mind. Using motion graphics software, this exercise will deal with the visualized word and ways to visualize and emphasize them through virtual-based techniques, where "virtual", in this case, means generated solely from the computer</p> <br>
                            <p>Choose a word. Using only digital imaging software such as Blender or Adobe After Effects, create a 1-2 minute motion graphic video that communicates something about the word. This can be based on the meaning of the word, its history, its contemporary usage, its associated subjects or objects, its appearance as a graphic shape, or any combination thereof. There are a combination of ways to approach this exercise. You can focus on the letterforms of the word themselves with particular attention to formal elements like shape, composition, duration, and color to convey your concept. You can also not visualize the word at all and instead try to depict your word using other sources. Or some variation between the two. Occupy the screen space freely and creatively. You are allowed to add other virtual objects, images, videos, sounds, music, and other elements in this exercise as long as it is not employed lazily or out of convenience. <span class="highlight">Bring your word to life</span>.</p>

                            <p>The aim of this exercise is to find unconventional, subversive, or innovative ways to create moving images. Create a 1-2 minute video about anything you like that uses a technique, software, or tool in a way that it is not normally to be used. We will learn about datamoshing, screen recording, and machinima in class. You may use these same methods from class but it is <span class="highlight">highly encouraged</span> that you conceive or find a technique or tool that we did not workshop together in class. Be experimental. Be prepared to explain why the imaging technique you used is unconventional.</p>

                            <p>Exercise X is a semester-long collaborative project in which we will experiment with the
                                creation, curation, and dissemination of digital images in a networked society. It is
                                separated into two parts:

                            <h5>The First Part</h5>
                            Pick a search term. Collect <b><u>10 images</u></b> from the search results using the search term (Ask me if you need help getting the photo from a platform).
                            This can be Google Images, DuckDuckGo, Twitter, Instagram, Are.na, Tumblr, Pintrest, Facebook, Amazon, Reddit,
                            Flickr,  and so on ++ <i class="highlight">Your selected images will contribute to a collective database for
                                class collaging.</i> Be mindful of your peers and the content that we will be engaged
                                with. I will use my own discretion to moderate the collection of images. If images submitted contain hateful, violent, or offensive material, it may not make it into the collection.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Images should be larger than 500px</li>
                                <li>Acceptable image formats include .png, .jpeg, .tiff, & .gif</li>

                            <p>One after another, each student will have 3 days to generate a collage using only the images from our curated database. This exercise will utilize the exhibition practices inherit in Instagram's grid feature. Collages will be uploaded onto our class Instagram account as they are generated.</p><br>
                            
                            <p>This exercise is designed to challenge this course's implications of what a "moving image" is. Instead of contextualizing moving images purely within the scope of time-based art (usually resulting in a video format), this exercise asks us to consider how digital images may move within social spaces, digital platforms, data infrastructures; how images today are consumed, curated, manipulated, generated, disseminated, and exhibited; how digital images may contribute to larger technological and social structures in our daily lives.</p>

                            In this project, you will be asked to select an existing piece of text to help you contextualize the scope of your video. You may interpret "text" broadly. From a single line from a poem / song / film / speech / advertisement or an idiom to a short story, an article, an essay, a passage from a book, or a scene from a screenplay. After choosing your piece of text, you will adapt this piece of text into a moving image video <span class="highlight">using only appropriated / pre-existing media material.</span> The original text itself must not appear in any form in the final video, but we should be able to identify the allusion or reference. The video should be between 2-5 minutes long.

                        <p>The appropriated footage you use must be in the public domain, available under appropriate <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licenses, or can be copyrighted material as long as you can justify your use under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" target="_blank">Fair Use</a> doctrine as a parody, critique, or meaningful transformation of the original. How can you use this project to re-purpose various footage thoughtfully to self-reflexively engage with the source material or to generate an entirely new creative work?

                        <p>Your final project is an open investigation of your interests and the techniques learned
                            throughout the course. As usual, it must be paired with audio and sound, which can be
                            musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 3 to
                            7 minutes. You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                            exploration of advanced and experimental techniques, software and frameworks that were not
                            touched on in the class, social and political issues, personal and interpersonal
                            investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention, and exploration
                            are highly encouraged. </p>
